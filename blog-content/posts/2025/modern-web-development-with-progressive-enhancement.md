# Modern Web Development with Progressive Enhancement

The world of web development is constantly evolving, and Progressive Enhancement strategy is becoming increasingly important for maximizing user experience when developing modern web applications.

## What is Progressive Enhancement?

Progressive Enhancement is a strategy for developing websites and applications layer by layer, starting with the basic content. This approach is based on the following principles:

1. **Basic Content Should Always Be Accessible**
   - Semantic and meaningful content with HTML
   - Simple structure that works in all browsers
   - Basic functionality without JavaScript

2. **Layered Development**
   - Visual improvements with CSS
   - Enhanced interaction with JavaScript
   - Extra features with modern APIs

## Progressive Enhancement in Modern Web

### 1. HTML Foundation
```html
<article class="blog-post">
  <h1>Blog Title</h1>
  <p>Blog content...</p>
  <button class="like-button">Like</button>
</article>
```

### 2. Enhancement with CSS
```css
.blog-post {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  padding: 1rem;
}

.like-button {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.2s;
}

.like-button:hover {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

### 3. Enrichment with JavaScript
```javascript
if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
  // Use IntersectionObserver for lazy loading
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        entry.target.src = entry.target.dataset.src;
        observer.unobserve(entry.target);
      }
    });
  });

  document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]').forEach(img => {
    observer.observe(img);
  });
}
```

## Benefits of Progressive Enhancement
