description: A personal reflection on the journey of writing, time passing, and returning to old habits.

Years ago… Many, many years ago… A young boy, driven by a passion for reading and writing, turned this curiosity into a journey of research—one that eventually became a habit intertwined with his daily life. This habit fueled his desire to gain new experiences and nurtured an inner urge to share them with others.

Yet, over time, he realized—like we all do—that the most powerful force shaping human growth is time itself. And as time went on, that very habit slowly drifted out of his life. This detachment sadly stretched over the years, and what was once a habit that used to ignite his inner fire morphed into a full-blown skill of laziness. Yes, a skill. It earned that name because it was masterfully used to self-sabotage—stepping in every time he tried to act on an idea, holding him back with nothing but his own hands.

An extended university life, a pandemic, injuries, and psychological turmoil... Eventually, this process evolved into more than just a habit or a skill; it became a kind of armor. And breaking this armor turned out to be far more difficult than imagined. Perhaps things could have been different with a crowd of people around to motivate him. But as the years passed, collaborating with others or inspiring one another became a barren desert. Whenever he voiced a dream or tried to create the conditions to bring one to life, a massive tumbleweed—like in an old western cartoon—would roll by in silence. And all he was left with was the empty gaze of ears that heard but did not listen.

Time… That abstract force that ticks on as hours pass, replacing physical vitality with so-called wisdom—etched in the lines of our bodies—somehow manages to manifest in very tangible ways. These effects, disguised as experience, show up again and again in real-life laboratories—our streets, our daily lives. And you see, you're not called "guilty" for not knowing or having experienced something—you're simply "inexperienced." But time, in its own way, gently removes that label as you rise or fall through its stages, offering the chance to gain experience. Whether you grow from it or not—whether you learn from the recurring scenarios in your life—is entirely up to you. In this sense, life is nothing more than a collection of experiences earned from a staged wrestling match between humans and time.

And my dear friends, beloved readers… I believe I've taken at least a few lessons from my share of that struggle, and I take joy in sharing this with you today.

From now on, I will try to replace this "skill of laziness" with the old habit of researching and sharing once again. Through Medium or my personal blog, I'll show you that those long years weren't entirely wasted—that I was still reading, still exploring, in the background. And hopefully, with a cup of coffee in hand and the fatigue of the day on your shoulders, you'll find space to read my reflections, engage with my thoughts, and share your own. I truly hope that in this journey, you'll enjoy joining me from time to time—and when you do, I kindly ask that you share your thoughts, whether positive or critical. Just remember: I might still be "inexperienced" in some areas of your journey too, and I'd love for your feedback to help me grow.

xoxo,
